					<h1>Why use social media?</h1>
					<div>
					            <p>	It’s fast, it’s viral, it can spark civic engagement, and it’s free. </p>
											<p>Social media helps cities in their core mission of reaching more constituents to more broadly share government information and activities. There are more than 900 million users on Facebook and more than 600 million users on Twitter. It’s the quickest, cheapest way to communicate and interact with your community.</p>
											<p>	The benefits of using social media are clearly evident; you can write in common language, raise awareness and participation in municipal activities, and build a stronger community. Social media can also increase government transparency, and allows you to communicate directly with residents.</p>
					          </div>
					          <div>
					  					<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
					  						<p>Social media does not replace traditional means of communication, rather it should be used to supplement standard methods.</p>
					  						<p>Don’t use social media just to use social media. Have a reason and a message to communicate. Pick and choose the platforms you wish to use, and use them loyally. It’s better to use one or two platforms regularly and well, than multiple networks infrequently and poorly.</p>
					  						<p>Try to keep the number of accounts per platform at a minimum. The more accounts you have, the more you segment your own community and minimize your reach. There are exceptions to the rule, however. Well-known city programs, events, or places that are associated with the city but have no immediate logical affiliation with the city, can in fact have a separate account. Examples include Zoos, Beaches, Parks, etc.</p>
					  						<p>Don’t use social media if you simply want to broadcast your message, it’s a conversation, and you have to participate by both providing information and listening to feedback.</p>

					      		<p>With more than 900 million active users, Facebook is the most widely-used social networking platform in the world. Facebook helps cities connect with residents and build community online. Facebook fanpages are used by many municipal governments to provide residents with information about government services and projects, local events, important rules and regulations, and other relevant topics. It’s also a forum to engage in a dialogue with residents, garner feedback, and strengthen relationships with the community.</p>
					          <p>There is one primary Facebook page for the City and County of Honolulu: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/honolulu.gov">facebook.com/Honolulu.Gov</a>.</p>
					      		<p>Here are two examples of city fanpages done well: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SF">City and County of San Francisco</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nycgov">City of New York</a>. </p>

											<h6><span class="numbers">1.</span> Go to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a></h6>

												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> If you don't already have a Twitter account (also known as handle), create one. Note: the more Twitter handles you have, the less effective your communication.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Create a username: It should be easily identifiable, include city name in it, and the word "gov" or "city" -- shorten if possible.</li> 
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Be consistent, try to use the same username throughout all social media.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> An “ @ ” will be added to the front of the name and always be included as part of the name (<a href="https://twitter.com/HonoluluGov">@HonoluluGov</a>).</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> It will then prompt you to build your profile by following others, making your profile searchable by category, and adding character (image and bio) to your profile. You have the option to skip this if needed; you can always do this later.</li>

					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> If you already have a Twitter account, ensure that your name or handle is easy to recognize, and sounds official.

										<h3 class="ribbon">The Fundamentals</h3>  
											<h6>Understand the landscape</h6>			
												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> With Twitter, you create tweets to share information with the public and follow others to stay informed.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> It's important to follow other community groups, community members, local businesses, organizations, governments and news outlets.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Each user has his or her own page, which can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/username">twitter.com/<i>username</i></a>. This page displays tweets of those you are following, and space to create a tweet.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Tweets are no more than 140 characters long. They can contain links.</li>
												</ul>
											<h6>Twitter tricks</h6>	
												<ul>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Use short links. You can shorten links at <a href="http://bitly.com">bitly.com</a>. Although Twitter automatically shortens links, using bit.ly or other url shorteners to tweet a shortlink is best practice. </li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Direct messaging: Allows you to privately communicate with a follower (only those users that follow you).</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Retweeting: Shares someone else’s tweet with your followers.</li>
													<li><span class="arrows">></span> Hashtags: The “ # ” symbol, called a hashtag, is used to categorize messages and associate themes. </li>
												</ul>
											<h6>Sample tweet</h6>  
												<ul>
													<li>“The <a href="https://twitter.com/honolulufest">@honolulufest</a> begins today. Join us downtown from 10-5 for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23music">#music</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23food">#food</a> and festivities! <a href="http://bit.ly/OKCyzk">http://bit.ly/OKCyzk</a>"</li>

					        <div class="program_cont row" id="tactic-twt"> 		
										<h3 class="ribbon">Some Tactics</h3>  
					            <h6>Minimize accounts</h6> 
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep active Twitter accounts to a minimum. Multiple Twitter accounts will only fragment your audience and the community of followers you wish to develop won’t be attainable unless account consolidation occurs. 
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> A new Twitter account (or handle) should only be created if there is a logical disconnection between the entity and the city, such as a zoo. Or if a specific department draws a specific dedicated, yet broad audience that is keen on being kept up date on the the departmental functions, such as the police department.
					              </ul>
					            <h6>Build your community</h6>
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Follow others. It's an easy way to get more people to follow you and grow your impression.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Retweet often. You want people to retweet you, so retweet them. It's a good way to build social capital.
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Tweet a variety of topics and media. Tweet information and notifications, as well as news articles, and less formal comments.
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Share video from your YouTube channel or pictures from Flickr.</li>
					              </ul>
					            <h6>Broaden your reach</h6>
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t start tweets with “ @ ” unless you're tweeting <i>at someone</i>. These are considered a <i>reply</i> and are not displayed to as broad of audience, and look like an internal conversation which will get ignored.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Use hashtags as often as possible. This allows for broader awareness of your message.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Create hashtags for a given topic or event such as the Honolulu Pride Parade (#hnlpride). Promote and get your community to use it as well.
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Garner responses by promoting a hashtag.
					                <li><i>Example:</i> “What do you think of the new play structure at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23Kilaueapark">#KilaueaPark</a>? Include <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23dolorespark">#KilaueaPark</a> in reply.”</li>
					              </ul>
					            <h6>Tactics</h6>      
					              <ul>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> When you tweet at someone, use the Twitter handle (name) at the beginning of the tweet. This allows for minimal viewing and indicates that you are speaking directly to that person.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Reply when mentioned or tweeted at. It's called “social” media after all!</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep your messages short and simple. You don't have to use all 140 characters.</li>
					                <li><span class="arrows">></span> Learn the lingo. <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/Twitter_Dictionary_Guide.asp">Look up the shorthand</a>.</li>

								<div class="program_cont row">
									<h3 class="ribbon">Overall</h3>
									<ul>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Designate who the primary person(s) will be to manage the account.</li>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span> For those using an existing profile with multiple account managers, designate a centralized location for logins and passwords.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Promote! Place the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social account information on business cards, websites, press releases, blogs, and any other location that can drive traffic.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> >Ask questions and try to encourage responses from your social communities. Make your networks a valuable resource for information and insight.</li>
                    <li><span class="arrows">></span>In general, messaging can be either public or private; private messaging should be minimized and only used when necessary.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Share everything from press releases and official statements to breaking news and city-wide announcements.</li> 
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> The point of Social Media is to easily share information with a community of people and to be able to broadcast messages to a broader audience than you can through other means.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Social implies a two-way street. Be sure to respond to postings, comments, or tweets in a timely manner.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Citizens will view Social Media as a platform to gain insight into city government and to contribute their voice.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> If you have any questions, or don’t understand something, Google it.</li> 
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> If content is shared that is inappropriate or off-message, delete it if it hasn't been commented on by people. If it has been noticed, apologize and correct it, don’t just quietly delete it.</li>
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Share your content across all networks, but be sure to tailor the message for each specific network.</li>							
										<li><span class="arrows">></span> Social Media can be used in addition to existing emergency notification systems, like Honolulu's <a href="http://www.honolulupd.org/info/nixle.htm">Nixle</a>. This is a quick and highly effective way to share important messages, PSA’s, and breaking news with your community.</li>
									</ul>	
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Frequency</h3>  
								<ul >
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Timeliness is key. For events or gatherings, post updates throughout to keep people immediately informed.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t overwhelm others by over-posting: people will become fatigued and you will lose fans/followers.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t repeat the same message more than once: it will overwhelm and annoy your audience. </li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t become obsolete due to lack of sharing of new information. Try to update your networks a minimum of once per day.</li>
									<li><span class="arrows">></span> Don’t post just because you can, only share things worth sharing.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Tone of Voice</h3>  
								<ul>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Create messages that will inspire others to share, like, and comment. The goal is to get your messages reposted and retweeted: this will help the word spread and reach many more people.</li> 
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Be casual and engaging, not authoritative and distant.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Active voice is better than passive voice.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Instead of “Advisory Message: Motorists are urged to avoid Keeaumoku Street in Honolulu”, write “Avoid Keeaumoku Street while driving.”</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Speak colloquially and use diction that is easy to understand.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Stay consistent, try to keep a similar style and language for each post.</li>
                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> Minimize the mentioning of acronyms unless it is already very widely understood. For example, many people may not now that “MOCA” stands for “Mayor’s Office of Culture and the Arts.” If you are unsure whether to abbreviate or not, it’s probably best to spell it out.</li>
                  <li><span class="arrows">></span> If a place, person, organzation, or whatever it is that you are mentioning in your tweet has a Twitter handle, use that Twitter handle in place of the name. It shows both social media adeptness, and friendliness.</li>
  								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Keep it short and stick to the point.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Unique Approaches</h3>  
								  <ul>	
								    <li><span class="arrows">></span> Tweetups (in-person meetups) and Twitter chats (organized chat through Twitter around a #hashtag)</li>
