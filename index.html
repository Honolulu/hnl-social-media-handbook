					<h1>Why use social media?</h1>
					<div>
            		<p>	It’s fast, it’s viral, it can spark civic engagement, and it’s free. </p>
						<p>Social media helps cities in their core mission of reaching more constituents to more broadly share government information and activities. There are more than 900 million users on Facebook and more than 600 million users on Twitter. It’s the quickest, cheapest way to communicate and interact with your community.</p>
						<p>	The benefits of using social media are clearly evident; you can write in common language, raise awareness and participation in municipal activities, and build a stronger community. Social media can also increase government transparency, and allows you to communicate directly with residents.</p>
					<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
						<p>Social media does not replace traditional means of communication, rather it should be used to supplement standard methods.</p>
						<p>Don’t use social media just to use social media. Have a reason and a message to communicate. Pick and choose the platforms you wish to use, and use them loyally. It’s better to use one or two platforms regularly and well, than multiple networks infrequently and poorly.</p>
						<p>Try to keep the number of accounts per platform at a minimum. The more accounts you have, the more you segment your own community and minimize your reach. There are exceptions to the rule, however. Well-known city programs, events, or places that are associated with the city  class="top_art_cont">
            			but have no immediate logical affiliation with the city, can in fact have a separate account. Examples include Zoos, Beaches, Parks, etc.</p>
						<p>Don’t use social media if you simply want to broadcast your message, it’s a conversation, and you have to participate by both providing information and listening to feedback.</p>

		<p>With more than 900 million active users, Facebook is the most widely-used social networking platform. Facebook helps cities connect with residents and build community online. Facebook fanpages are used by many municipal governments to provide residents with information about government services and projects, local events, important rules and regulations, and other relevant topics. It’s also a forum to engage in a dialogue with residents, garner feedback, and strengthen relationships with the community.</p>

		<p>There is one primary Facebook page for the City and County of Honolulu: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/honolulu.gov">facebook.com/honolulu.gov</a>.</p>
			<p>Here are a two examples of City fanpages done well: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SF">City and County of San Francisco</a>, and

				<div class="top_art_cont">
					<p>Twitter is one of the most frequented social media networks in existence today. Designed to instantly connect users to what's most important; you can follow other cities, local business, community leaders, and news outlets. The nature of the platform is viral -- individuals passing along one another's comments to their own networks -- making it one of the quickest, easiest methods to broadcast information to a expansive audience.<br /> 
					<p>There is one primary Twitter account for the City and County of Honolulu:<a href="http://twitter.com/honolulugov"> @HonoluluGov</a></p>

						<h6><span class="numbers">2.</span> If you don't have an accout, get setup.</h6>
							<ul>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>If you don't already have a Twitter handle, create one. Note: the more Twitter handles, the less effective the your communication.</li>
                        		<li><span class="arrows">></span> Create a username: It should be easily identifiable, include city name in it, and the word "gov" or "city" -- shorten if possible.</li> 
								<li><span class="arrows">></span> Be consistent, try to use the same username throughout all social media.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span> An “ @ ” will be added to the front of the name and always be included as part of the name (<a href="https://twitter.com/CityofSunnyvale">@HonoluluGov</a>).</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span> It will then prompt you to build your profile by following others, making your profile searchable by category, and adding character (image and bio) to your profile. You have the option to skip this if needed; you can always do this later.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Confirm the email address and you're done!</li>	
						<h6><span class="numbers">2.</span> Edit your profile</h6>

					<h3 class="ribbon">The Fundamentals</h3>  
						<h6>Understand the landscape</h6>			
							<ul>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>With Twitter, you create tweets to share information with the public and follow others to stay informed.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>It's important to follow other community groups, community members, local businesses, organizations, governments and news outlets.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Each user has his or her own page, which can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/username">twitter.com/<i>username</i></a>. This page displays tweets of those you are following, and space to create a tweet.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Tweets are no more than 140 characters long. They can contain links.</li>
							</ul>
						<h6>Twitter tricks</h6>	
							<ul>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Use short links. You can shorten links at <a href="http://bitly.com">bitly.com</a>. Although Twitter automatically shortens links, using bit.ly or other url shorteners to tweet a shortlink is best practice. </li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Direct messageing: Allows you to privately communicate with a follower (only those users that follow you).</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Retweeting: Shares someone else’s tweet with your followers.</li>
								<li><span class="arrows">></span>Hashtags: The “ # ” symbol, called a hashtag, is used to categorize messages and associate themes. </li>
							</ul>
						<h6>Sample tweet</h6>  
							<ul>
								<li>“The <a href="https://twitter.com/honolulufest">@honolulufest</a> begins today.

							</ul>			
					<h3 class="ribbon">Some Tactics</h3>  
									<ul>
										<li>Keep active accounts to a minimum. Multiple Twitter accounts will only fragment your audience and the community of followers you wish to develop won’t be attainable unless account consolidation occurs. 
											<ul>
												<li>Here’s how the accounts can be consolidated in Honolulu: &nbsp; <a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/imgs/twitter_acctinfo.jpg">www1.honolulu.gov/imgs/twitter_acctinfo.jpg</a></li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Follow others. An easy way to get more people to follow you and grow your impression.</li>
										<li>Don’t start tweets with “ @ ” unless you're tweeting <i>at someone</i>. They look like a conversation and get ignored.</li>
										<li>Create hashtags for a given topic or event (#sfprideparade). This allows for broader awareness of your message.</li>
										<li>Garner responses by promoting a hashtag.
											<ul>
												<li>Example: “What do you think of the new play structure at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23dolorespark">#DoloresPark</a>? Include <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23dolorespark">#DoloresPark</a> in reply”</li></ul></li>
										<li>When you tweet at someone, use a Twitter handle (name) at the beginning of the tweet. This allows for minimal viewing and indicates that you are speaking directly to that person.</li>
										<li>Reply when mentioned or tweeted at. It's called “social” media after all!</li>
										<li>Be sure to add your city's website to your character’s “About” section.</li>
										<li>Keep your messages short and simple.</li>
										<li>Look up the shorthand: <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/Twitter_Dictionary_Guide.asp">www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/Twitter_Dictionary_Guide.asp</a></li></ul>

									<h3 class="ribbon">Some Tactics</h3>  
									<ul>
										<li>Share your photos across Facebook and Twitter. 
											<ul>
												<li>Use Flickr as your centralized hub so all your city’s photos can be easily viewable in a single location.</li>
												<li>Each photo uploaded to Flickr will have a unique URL. You can link directly to a specific photo, a set, or a gallery of photos.</li>
												<li>Each photo uploaded will also have a unique HTML embed code. Use this embed code for websites and email blasts if you would like to display that photo.</li></ul></li>
									<li>Photos are the best way to easily and quickly highlight events or provide updates.</li>
									<li>Use photos to show happenings around the city and allow the community to stay informed and be involved.</li>
									<li>Joining groups related to your community is a great way to develop a following.</li></ul>

								<h1>Strategy</h1>
								
								<div class="program_cont row">
									<h3 class="ribbon">Overall</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Promote! Place the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social account information on business cards, websites, press releases, blogs, and any other location that can drive traffic.</li>
										<li>Ask questions and try to encourage responses from your social communities. Make your networks a valuable resource for information and insight.</li>
										<li>Share everything from press releases and official statements to breaking news and city-wide announcements.</li> 
										<li>The point of Social Media is to easily share information with a community of people and to be able to broadcast messages to a broader audience than you can through other means.</li>
										<li>Social implies a two-way street. Be sure to respond to postings, comments, or tweets in a timely manner.</li>
										<li>Citizens will view Social Media as a platform to gain insight into city government and to contribute their voice.</li>
										<li>If you have any questions, or don’t understand something, just GOOGLE IT.</li> 
										<li>If content is shared that is inappropriate or off-message, delete it if it hasn't been commented on by people. If it has been noticed, apologize and correct it, don’t just quietly delete it.</li>
										<li>Share your content across all networks, but be sure to tailor the message for each specific network.</li>							
										<li>Social Media can be used in addition to existing emergency notification systems (like Nixle in Honolulu: <a href="http://www.honolulupd.org/info/nixle.htm">honolulupd.org/info/nixle.htm</a>). This is a quick and highly effective way to share important messages, PSA’s, and breaking news with your community.</li>
									</ul>	
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Frequency</h3>  
								<ul >
									<li>Timeliness is key. For events or gatherings, post updates throughout to keep people immediately informed.</li>
									<li>Don’t overwhelm others by over-posting: people will become fatigued and you will lose fans/followers.</li>
									<li>Don’t repeat the same message more than once: it will overwhelm and annoy your audience. </li>
									<li>Don’t become obsolete due to lack of sharing of new information. Try to update your networks a minimum of once per day.</li>
									<li>Don’t post just because you can, only share things worth sharing.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Tone of Voice</h3>  
								<ul>
  								<li>Create messages that will inspire others to share, like, and comment. The goal is to get your messages reposted and retweeted: this will help the word spread and reach many more people.</li> 
  								<li>Be casual and engaging, not authoritative and distant.</li>
  								<li> Active voice is better than passive voice.
  								<ul>
  								<li>Instead of “Advisory Message: Motorists are urged to avoid Keeaumoku Street in Honolulu”, write “Avoid Keeaumoku Street while driving.”</li></ul></li>
  								<li>Speak colloquially and use diction that is easy to understand.</li>
  								<li>Stay consistent, try to keep a similar style and language for each post. </li>
  								<li>Be short and stick to the point.</li>
                </ul>
								
								<h3 class="ribbon">Unique Approaches</h3>  
								<ul>	
								<li>Tweetups (in-person meetups) and Twitter chats (organized chat through Twitter around a #hashtag)</li>
								<li>Examples:
									<ul>	
									<li>City of Palo Alto’s Mayor’s Twitter chat: <a href="http://civiccommons.org/stories/palo-alto-mayor-chats-residents">civiccommons.org/stories/palo-alto-mayor-chats-residents</a></li>
									<li>City of Chicago’s transit authority receives e-mails and tweets from riders. They could cull comments on Twitter to respond to complaints and bolster long term planning efforts: <a href="http://civiccommons.org/stories/using-social-media-monitor-public-sentiment">civiccommons.org/stories/using-social-media-monitor-public-sentiment</a></li></ul></li></ul>
									
								<h3 class="ribbon">Multiple Accounts</h3>  
								<ul>	
									<li>Set up Hootsuite to manage multiple accounts: <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">hootsuite.com</a></li>
									<li>Follow the prompts to add your social accounts
										<ul>	
										<li>Up to five accounts at no cost</li></ul></li>	
									<li>Schedule tweets and posts for later dates and times
										<ul>	
										<li>How to schedule: <a href="http://help.hootsuite.com/entries/240929-how-to-schedule-in-hootsuite">help.hootsuite.com/entries/240929-how-to-schedule-in-hootsuite</a></li></ul></li>
									<li>Tailor your message for the proper network
										<ul>	
										<li>Facebook doesn’t use or recognize theme hashtags</li></ul></li></ul>
							
								<h3 class="ribbon">Emergency Communications</h3>  
								<ul>	
									<li>Inform your community during emergencies or disasters through social media, as it is one of the quickest, easiest, most far-reaching channels available</li>
									<li>Be short, honest, and to the point</li>
									<li>Use the same format and framing across all networks to eliminate any misunderstandings or confusion</li></ul>
						
								<h3 class="ribbon">Learning and Analytics</h3>  
								<ul>	
									<li>Use Facebook’s built-in analytics, accessible via the admin panel, to get a better idea about which content is driving traffic and shared most</li>
									<li>Make future decisions based on how the community is responding and engaging with the content</li>
									<li>Google Analytics is a great tool to monitor data related to your social campaign. 
										<ul>	
											<li>If a more detailed aggregate for social analytics is needed, more information can be found at <a href="http://www.meadigital.com/clickosity/2011/08/google-analytics-social-media-guide/">meadigital.com/clickosity/2011/08/google-analytics-social-media-guide</a></li></ul></li></ul>
											
								<h3 class="ribbon">LinkedIn</h3>  
									<p> If you want to attract potential job applicants, share the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn.com</a>  job posting across social networks. Be sure to include any information a potential applicant should know.</p>
